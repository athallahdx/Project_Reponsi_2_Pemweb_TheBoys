                    Marvin T. Milk, better known as Mother’s Milk, is the steadfast heart and moral compass of The Boys. A former U.S. Marine with a deep sense of justice, Mother’s Milk is the team’s strategist, investigator, and a grounding presence amidst their often chaotic missions. His nickname, while unconventional, stems from his unwavering commitment to taking care of others, much like a mother to her family. Mother’s Milk acts as the glue that holds the team together. He is often the voice of reason, balancing Billy Butcher’s fiery leadership and Hughie’s idealism. His deep sense of responsibility extends to protecting his family, particularly his daughter, which serves as a personal motivation to fight against Vought’s corruption.
