                    <p>The Seven are Vought International's golden ticket to power, fame, and profit. Marketed as Earth's mightiest protectors, they are the shining faces plastered across billboards, action figures, and cereal boxes. But behind the carefully crafted heroism lies a darker truth: The Seven are not saviors—they’re a product. Every heroic act is a publicity stunt, every smile a corporate strategy, and every victory a scripted spectacle.</p>

                        <p>What happens when the cameras stop rolling? Behind the scenes, The Seven are plagued with scandals, abuses of power, and moral corruption. They operate not out of a sense of justice, but a hunger for control and validation. Their powers might be godlike, but their flaws are disturbingly human—egos unchecked, appetites insatiable, and consciences conveniently absent.</p>

                    <div class="text3">
                        <p>Vought has sold the world a dream: a world protected by invincible heroes. But that dream is a nightmare dressed in spandex and smiles. The Seven are not here to save us; they’re here to save themselves—whether from irrelevance or their own inner demons.</p>

                    <p>Let’s pull back the curtain on The Seven and reveal the truth that Vought doesn’t want you to see: not all heroes wear capes. And sometimes, the ones who do are the real villains.</p>
